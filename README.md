### Landing page
PetLife is a simple application for storing pet information. On the landing page we have two options:
- Login: Redirects the user to the login page
- Create Account: Redirects users to a create account page

> Note: We use protected routes to protect the application and the users personal information. For example if you were to attempt to bypass the login process and enter the hashed ID such as https://pet-life-2019.herokuapp.com/user/5db3258a376a8f002a6be58d/petfamily (the hashed id for the test account provided below) in the url bar, you will be redirected back to the login page.

### Login Page
Feel free to follow along with the example account information above or create your own account.

### Pet Family Page
This is the main pet family page. The user is allowed to add pets to their family and logout in the top right of the screen.

### Pet Info Page
The Pet Info tab gives the user a very quick overview of their pets and has the ability to remove pets from their family.

### Pet Prescriptions Page
The prescription page allows users to add prescriptions for their pets based on the tabbed pet selected.

### Pet Doctors Visits Page
